Email-Count-Pusher-to-iOS-Device
================================

To use this script you have to create a certificate, so you can use the push notification system, and paste it in the root directory (it should be named 'ck.pem', but you can change the script to adapt to your name) and then paste your device token and passphrase into the script. More can be done from this script :p
